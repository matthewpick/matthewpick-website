A couple weekend ago, I decided to build a simple clipboard manager, heavily inspired by Copy 'Em.

I've used Copy 'Em Paste for years, but wanted something more barebones.

The parts that were most important to me:
- No syncing between devices
- Open source
- Easy to install via Homebrew
- Completely free clipboard manager I can recommend to coworkers
- Lightweight and minimal
- Improved / stripped down UX from what I was already used to with Copy 'Em

<div class="not-prose my-6 p-5 rounded-xl bg-sand/50 dark:bg-forest/50 border border-sand dark:border-forest text-charcoal/80 dark:text-off-white/80">

Claude Code helped tremendously get up and running quickly. 
It's been wild seeing how fast these tools are getting in the past year. 
I had not used LLM-assisted coding tools before 2025, and now I can't imagine going back. 
I started with GitHub Copilot at my day-job, but Claude Code has been a game-changer at home.

It has taken some of the fun out of programming for me, but I do enjoy the satisfaction of building a lot faster than I could before. 
There are definitely pros and cons to this new way of building software, but it has been a net positive to me so far.

There are just so many projects I wouldn't typically have the energy to build, but now I feel like I can go from 
zero to about 70-80% complete in a single weekend.

I was able to get a working prototype in just a few hours, and then spent the rest of the weekend
dialing in the ux to be exactly what I wanted.

Overall, I ended up with something that was the best of both worlds:
- Familiar UX from Copy 'Em Paste
- Open source aspect of Maccy Clipboard

I've been daily-driving Pesto Clipboard ever since that first weekend claude code session, and it's been
fantastic. If you're looking for a simple clipboard manager for macOS, give it a try!
